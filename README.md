# QuickSSH
A simple OpenSSH Server List that stores everything in a list file.

## Easy to use and cool
I made this code just because i wanted a "centralized" way to connect to my SSH Servers from my tablet that looked cool.
<br>
<br>
It should be compatible with both Windows and Linux. (Although I couldn't compile it with clang it works perfectly fine with g++(gcc).)
<br>
There are basically just 5 functions, Quit, Save a Server, Delete a Server, Print every saved Server and open a Connection with a Server.
<br>
I also made sure the program doesn't crash even if you play around with the list file.

### The Configuration Options can be found in the source code as defines, explainations can be found over them as comments.

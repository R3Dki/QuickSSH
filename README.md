# QuickSSH
A simple OpenSSH Server List

## Easy to use and cool
I made this little piece of code just because i wanted a "centralized" way to connect to my SSH Servers from my tablet.
It should be 100% compatible with both Windows and especially Linux.
There are basically just 5 functions, Quit, Save a Server, Delete a Server, Print every saved Server and open a connection with a Server.
I made sure the program doesn't crash even if you play around with the list file.
